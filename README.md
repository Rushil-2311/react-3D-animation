# react-3D-animation
here i have created one 3d animation with the help of react 3d and react fiber
# you have to just follow my header.js component and then see the animation and try to understand with the three.js conept if you dont able to understand then just go through the documentation of the three.js and see how i used the thier concept to implement such things
